# perPixelCollision

This is a repo to coordinatinate our efforts to build a small example of part of a library in order to maybe merge it into MG.Extended later on.

## Contents
* Load textures from XNB.-file
* Get the color-data from textures for test
* Get the transformation matrix for a texture being rotated around a custom center, scaled in respect to a custom center and positioned in respect to a custom point
* Per pixel collision-testing method for those textures and matrices
