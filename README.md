# perPixelCollision

This is a repo to coordinatinate our efforts to build a small example of part of a library in order to maybe merge it into MonoGame.Extended later on.

Used the MonoGame.Extended demo project for illustration.

# Setup
Since this is a MonoGame.Extended demo project it needs MG.Extended obviously.
Open the solution file in VS 2015.
Then open the NuGet console by selecting `Tools` from the menu and then `NuGet Package Manager` and `PackageManager Console` and type the following command:
```
Install-Package MonoGame.Extended
```
Then re-open the project in VS 2015 and run it.
*(You may have to correct the references to MonoGame.Framework.dll or MonoGame.Extended.dll manually. They are located in the packages-subfolder generated by NuGet after the execution of the command above.)*

## Contents
* Load textures from XNB.-file.
* Get the color-data from textures for test.
* Transform the color-data into a smaller bool-array containing true for pixels with alpha>0.
* Get the transformation matrix for a texture being rotated around a custom center, scaled and positioned.
* Per pixel collision-testing method for those textures and matrices.
* Color the sprites read when they per-pixel-intersect.
